# Image-Smoothing-Optimization
Lab Showing Optimized Image Smoothing as part of Luther Tychonievich's CS3330 Sp22 Lab 12

The code contained in this repository mostly was written by Luther Tychonievich's and is included for the test to be operational. However, the optimization in smooth.c is written by me. The optimization resulted in a 5.19x speedup from the naive implementation of smooth. 

I do not endorse the use of this code for the completion of any academic assignments.

To use:

run `make`

run `./benchmark`
